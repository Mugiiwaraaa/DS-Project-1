# DS-Project-1
Engineered a model that estimates and predicts the price for Real Estate

* Designed a model that estimates the prices of real estate (Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000â€™s) to optimize future real estate purchases (minimizing losses) as housing prices are an important reflection of the economy, and housing price ranges are of great interest for both buyers and sellers.
* Dataset - Scraped and fetched data from the UCI ML Repository for the model. The Dataset includes various features describing the housing situation in Boston such as Number of Rooms, Crime Rate, Tax ,etc.
* Model - The major aim of in this project is to predict the house prices based on the features using some of the regression techniques and algorithms. Optimized Linear, DecisionTree and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.

## About the Dataset ##
Housing prices are an important reflection of the economy, and housing price ranges are of great interest for both buyers and sellers. In this project, house prices will be predicted given relatable features that cover many aspects of residential houses. The Goal is to train a model that can further estimate and give us accurate real estate price predictions
